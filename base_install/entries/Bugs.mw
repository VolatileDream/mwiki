Notice something that didn't work the way you think it should? Go to https://github.com/VolatileDream/mwiki/issues/ and report it! If you can answer the following questions with as much detail as possible, it'll really help fixing the problem:

 * What happened?
 ** Step by step break down of the @mwiki commands you executed.
 ** Any relevant non-mwiki commands that were run (did you edit #Tupfile, or some other thing outside of @mwiki?)

 * What did you expect to happen?
 ** Where did the steps start going wrong?
 ** Is there more than one thing that has gone wrong?
 ** What output did you expect from each part?

 * Propose a fix, what should've happened instead?
 ** We aren't mind readers, if you say "it should work" we don't know what you mean by 'work'.
 ** If you have an idea about when or how things should happen, say so.
