This plugin only really makes sense to use with the #Journal plugin.

It assumes that file names are dates, and looks for lines starting with "!event", "!event-start", and "!event-end" and then outputs these events into a single timeline file.

This file is kept up to date as the journal evolves, and different events occur and end.

Note that file names are "YYYY-MM-DD.mw" format, as are the dates output by this plugin.

# Example
> # 1990-01-01.mw
> !event I was born!
>
> # 1993-02-02.mw
> !event I said my first word: mine
>
> # 2010-03-03.mw
> !event-start I'm dating Alex
>
> # 2012-04-04.mw
> # Note that this entry mirrors the above item exactly!
> # This is how the plugin detects the end of an event.
> !event-end I'm dating Alex
>
> # 2015-05-05.mw
> # This event isn't terminated
> !event-start Studying for Phd
