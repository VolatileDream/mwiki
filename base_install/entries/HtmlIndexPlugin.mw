The @HtmlIndexPlugin is one of three @CorePlugins, it is responsible for generation of the landing page for the wiki when executing `mwiki browse`. It distinguishes between user generated pages, and automatically generated plugin pages via a naming convention.

## Autogenerated Pages

Pages not created by a user (that is: generated by a plugin by aggregating data from other pages) are expected to have a name starting with '~'. This allows the @HtmlIndexPlugin to correctly group them together and keep user generated content separate. Additionally, these pages need to be placed in the <meta> Tup group to ensure that dependencies between them and the index are tracked correctly.
