The #JournalPlugin uses the wiki structure to house a journal.

It includes a bash completion script, and several extensions which make working with dated entries easier.

It takes advantage of setting $MWIKI_DIR before executing #mwiki to use it's own configuration.

## Dependencies

This depends on core linux utilities, while extensions to the journal also add dependencies on:

 * swish++ (already depended on by the `plugin.d/search++`)
 * git
 * aspell
