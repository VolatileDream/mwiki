The Mentions plugin generates a list of links to a particular page.

It's composed of two parts: the indexer, and extractor.

## Indexer

The indexer is run by the Tup rules provided by the plugin, and generates
a map of pages that link to other pages. It's a relatively simple format,
based on the hope that no page name contains the string " :: ".

### Index Format
<page> " :: " [#@]<page>

## Extractor

Another simple script, it generates a list of pages that link to the current
page. It's invoked by the #RenderPlugin, which inserts the list of mentions
at the bottom of the page.

## Bugs?

There's one tiny little problem with running the extractor: existing pages
won't be updated when a new page that links to them is added. See
#TupUpdateBug for more.
