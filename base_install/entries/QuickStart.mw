Welcome to @mwiki! This is a friendly guide to get you started with using @mwiki.

# Bare Bones Setup

It might surprise you but not everything in the base install is required. It's really just the collection of every "official" plugin that is provided by @mwiki.

The only required plugins are:

 * @JoinPlugin - joins data from various plugins into a final version of a page to be turned into #HTML
 * @BasePlugin - turns final page versions into #HTML
 * @IndexPlugin - generates the index page (which links to all pages and generated meta-pages)

Really useful plugins:

 * @MentionsPlugin - finds all the mentions of a page in other pages
 * @MissingPlugin - generates a meta page of all missing links in the entire wiki (and displays the pages where they are used)

Other plugins that are included but not required, and possibly not terribly useful:

 * @SearchppPlugin - using @swishpp (swish++) it creates a search index over the wiki
 * @JournalPlugin - an additional utility that wraps @mwiki to create a personal journal
 * @EventsPlugin - adds support for aggregating events across journal entries
 * @QuotesPlugin - adds support for aggregating quotes across pages

# mwiki Plugin Organization

All of the @mwiki plugins are referenced from a central file (#Tupfile). This file lists the (loose) order in which the plugins should be running, and which plugins to run. Each plugin has their own set of @Tup rules to say what they take as input and what they provide as output.

# Whoa, that was unexpected

There are a few known @mwikiBugs at the moment, most notably when adding a new page the default `mwiki browse` page won't have it after editting.

Notice something that didn't work the way you think it should? Go to https://github.com/VolatileDream/mwiki/issues/ and report it! If you can answer the following questions with as much detail as possible, it'll really help fixing the problem:

 * What happened?
 ** Step by step break down of the @mwiki commands you executed.
 ** Any relevant non-mwiki commands that were run (did you edit #Tupfile, or some other thing outside of @mwiki?)

 * What did you expect to happen?
 ** Where did the steps start going wrong?
 ** Is there more than one thing that has gone wrong?
 ** What output did you expect from each part?

 * Propose a fix, what should've happened instead?
 ** We aren't mind readers, if you say "it should work" we don't know what you mean by 'work'.
 ** If you have an idea about when or how things should happen, say so.
