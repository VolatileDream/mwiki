Welcome to @mwiki! This is a friendly guide to get you started with using @mwiki.

## Bare Bones Setup

It might surprise you but not everything in the base install is required. It's really just the collection of every "official" plugin that is provided by @mwiki.

The #CorePlugins are:

 * @RenderPlugin - joins data from various plugins into a final version of a page to be turned into #HTML
 * @HtmlPlugin - turns final page versions into #HTML
 * @HtmlIndexPlugin - generates the index page (which links to all pages and generated meta-pages)

Really useful plugins:

 * @MentionsPlugin - finds all the mentions of a page in other pages
 * @MissingPlugin - generates a meta page of all missing links in the entire wiki (and displays the pages where they are used)

Other plugins that are included but not required, and possibly not terribly useful depending on your use case:

 * @SearchppPlugin - using @swishpp (swish++) it creates a search index over the wiki
 * @JournalPlugin - an additional utility that wraps @mwiki to create a personal journal
 * @EventsPlugin - adds support for aggregating events across journal entries
 * @QuotesPlugin - adds support for aggregating quotes across pages

## mwiki Plugin Organization

All of the @mwiki plugins are referenced from a central file (#Tupfile). This file lists the (loose) order in which the plugins should be running, and which plugins to run. Each plugin has their own set of @Tup rules to say what they take as input and what they provide as output.

Visit #WritingPlugins to see how to add new plugins, and interact correctly with the base plugin set.

## Whoa, that was unexpected

There are a few known @Bugs at the moment, most notably when adding a new page the default `mwiki browse` page won't have it after editing.
