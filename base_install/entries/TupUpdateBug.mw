There's a known #Bug with #Tup that means it doesn't pick up new files
that have been added to existing wildcard matches.

What does this mean in practice?

There's a few plugins that use wildcards to process all files, and they
won't get updated correctly when adding new files. Most notably, the
#HtmlIndexPlugin works around this because #mwiki itself forces the
recreation of the index on every update. However others, like the
#MentionsPlugin aren't setup like this, and won't update existing pages
when new ones are added.
