# So you want to write an @mwiki plugin...

Writting @mwiki plugins is fairly simple, as they usually consist of two parts.

The first part is the @Tup rules that say what input is used to generate what output.

The second part is the small executable that modifies the input into the output.

# Installing a Plugin

Once your plugin is done, you will need to include the rules into the base Tupfile.

If you look at the Tupfile, you'll see how all the other plugins are included into the file.

Note that the order that they are included is important. If your plugin interacts with the output of another plugin, make sure it gets included after it. Because of this, you should make sure that it is included before the @JoinPlugin, @BasePlugin, and @IndexPlugin.

# Adding Output to Pages

If your plugin is generating extra output to add to the final generated pages, you'll need to update the @JoinPlugin.
