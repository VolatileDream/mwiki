@mwiki's linking format uses # and @ to denote a block of characters that should be linked. The two characters are interchangable, although they are setup so that conventions on their use may be put in place. Such as using @ for proper nouns (people, places, things) and # for everything else.

Unlinke other #wiki technology, which may use specialized #syntax or #CamelCase words.
