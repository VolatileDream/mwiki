include plugin.d/join/Tupfile
# implementation detail:
# join expects that plugins will be added to the
# plugin.d/join/order file, to indicate the order to join the fragments
# in.

# other plugins that generate page fragments are expected to conform to
# the convention that join has setup. This means that fragments should
# be generated into build/meta/%B.$plugin-name, as well as adding the
# fragment to the build/meta/<%B> group. This is the only way the join
# plugin will find the page fragments.

include plugin.d/mentions/Tupfile

# mwiki plugins that autogenerate pages are expected to generate pages
# that start with a '~', this means that the meta index page will be
# able to find them all and list them. As well as being put in the 
# <meta> group to ensure dependencies are correctly ordered.

include plugin.d/index/Tupfile

# By convention, the index plugin creates '#.html' which is the default
# entry point of mwiki.
